As time has quickly moved forward, I feel the need to update others on the progress of my Ph.D.
For those of you that are interested here is the basic "checklist" of where my Ph.D. is at as of this
date (roughly the middle of November 2021):

- [x] Re-enter graduate school
- [x] Take the Preliminary Exam
- [x] Complete Required Coursework
- [x] Complete Research for 1st paper ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/?title=progress)
- [ ] Complete Research for 2nd paper ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/50/?title=progress)
- [ ] Complete Research for 3rd paper ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/0/?title=progress)
- [ ] Complete 1st paper ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/60/?title=progress)
- [ ] Complete 2nd paper ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/20/?title=progress)
- [ ] Complete 3rd paper ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/0/?title=progress)
- [ ] Complete Dissertation (Draft) ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/10/?title=progress)
- [ ] Complete Pre-defense meeting
- [ ] Complete Dissertation Defense

The progress is just a guess of what it should be.  Although those bars may not show it, my progress is about
halfway or so done.  The course work and preliminary requirements are finished and I am in what I'd like to
call the "research" phase.  It is pretty much the time where a student more or less just focuses on research and writing.
Since my re-entrance into graduate school (about 2.5 years ago), I have made significant progress in my research, but in 2020 and 2021 I hit a few large speed bumps along the way.   Not just common things like the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic, but also stuff
like health and family.

As of today, I do not forsee these things being issues anymore.  I am writing for more than an hour, reading a paper, and developing my [Quick Studies](https://nmg5038.github.io/Quick%20Studies/) for insertion into my Dissertation.  These will continue to increase in the following weeks and I
look forward to sharing my findings and future with you!
