I'll be honest.  Throughout my youth one of the skills I struggled with the most is perhaps the 2nd most
important skill you need in academia: reading

When I first entered graduate school, I struggled with this.  Over and over again, I would simply ignore this important position.   As a metaphor, it would be like if a medical doctor never read the latest methods or went to any seminars.  You can clearly see how this can derail your ambitions if you want to be successful in academia.

Anywho, after a stark wake-up call in 2015, I had to reform myself.  I knew that reading was a weak point and so I made two adjustments
<ol>
  <li>Read a minimum of 10 pages from a non-fiction book each day</li>
  <li>Read at least one academic paper related to my field each day</li>
</ol>

Now the first step, basically is a training method to get you used to reading more often in a disciplined fashion.   A non-fiction book will at least keep me entertained with non-science (sometimes) subjects and how to digest more pop-ish mediums.

The second step is more relevant to this discussion.  I follow it exactly as it is stated, but the depth at which I read papers is not always the same.  I follow a form of Praeto's 80-20 principle...where I digest many papers but only focus on a few.  You can think of the ones needing more attention as foundational paper and the others as support or general knowledge papers.

To get at the core of this is to be efficient in reading, so I've broken the level at which I read a paper into 3 basic categories
<ol>
  <li>Getting the basic gist (a skim read)</li>
  <li>Getting the whole story (a full read)</li>
  <li>Replicating the story (a full read + replication of stuff)</li>
</ol>

From 2015 through 2018, I mostly read either level 2 or level 3.  That's great if you want to deep dive every paper, but it is VERY inefficient if you trying to expand your horizon quickly.   Sort of like go broad, then go deep.  In 2019, I changed this so I would read every paper first at the 1st level.  That way I got the major talking points and conclusions.   This cut my daily reading of science papers from about 1-2 hours to about 10 mins.  Thus, I got to read many more papers more quickly, but not nearly as deep.  

While one might think this is not great for deeper understanding, I would oppose that statement.  Structuring my reading in this manner markedly helped my comprehension of the work and where it fit into the bigger picture.  This is because my level 1 reading keeps the bandwidth in my brain in an state where I could critically think...rather than focus only on the details.

There is more to this, but that is part 2 where I'll explain my skimming proceedure.
