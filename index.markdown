<p>Hello! This is the website for Nicholas Geyer.  I am a Research Associate
and Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Colorado State University.
I work for the Denning Biocycle Research Group.</p>

Within the pages of this website you will find examples of code, writing,
and derivations I have put together over the years.  Please enjoy the visit!</p>

<p> Note: If you would like to get in contact with me, then my preferred method is through the
